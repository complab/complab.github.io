title: Tech talks
---


We will hold a series of technical seminars over lunch on Mondays from Jan 26 to March 9 in 2015. They are open to anyone interested: students, practitioners and researchers are welcome! The focus of the seminars will be on interesting challenges in industry.

Along with the seminars, students will also be offered a [course on academic writing](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~laurako/links/CCTT.html) related to the seminars.

Information about speakers will appear soon(-ish).
