# Computing Lab Tech Talks

We will hold a series of technical seminars over lunch on Mondays from Jan 26 to March 9 in 2015. They are open to anyone interested: students, practitioners and researchers are welcome! The focus of the seminars will be on interesting challenges in industry.

Lunch baguettes will be served for the early-comers.

Along with the seminars, students will also be offered a [course on academic writing](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~laurako/links/CCTT.html) related to the seminars.

The tech talks are sponsored by the [ICT Area of Advance](http://www.chalmers.se/en/areas-of-advance/ict/Pages/default.aspx).
