# Welcome to Chalmers Computing Lab!

The Computing Lab is an initiative by [Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.chalmers.se/cse/) which aims to be a forum where people from industry and academia can meet and find common interests.

Our first move is to launch a [seminar series](tech-talks.html) to be held over lunch on Mondays in the beginning of 2015.
