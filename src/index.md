# Welcome to Chalmers Computing Lab!

The Computing Lab is an initiative by [Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.chalmers.se/cse/) which aims to be a forum where people from industry and academia can meet and find common interests.

We started out with a [series of lunch seminars](tech-talks-2015-01/index.html) in the beginning of 2015, and we are planning a new series in Nov 2015.
